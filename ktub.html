        KTUB History
    </h1>
    <p>
        In 1996, at the Kirkland Youth Summit, hundreds of young individuals presented a mandate to the City stating that they wanted Kirkland to be a better place for them and their teen peers. An idea that came about was to open a teen center for teens to hang out after school. In the summer of 2001, the KTUB facility was officially opened to the youth public of Kirkland.  

In 2024, KTUB was reopened to the public once more after multiple years of rebuilding and renovations since the COVID-19 pandemic.

<h1>
    Why does KTUB matter as a part of Kirkland’s Community? 
</h1>
<p>
    KTUBs' mission is to provide a place that is “committed to uplifting teens' identities, voices, and their right to exist and thrive with dignity and respect in an inclusive, safe space.” (from the City of Kirkland’s webpage about KTUB)  

If you have a teen or are a teen, KTUB is a great place to connect with other teens. They offer multiple classes after school, giving kids a time to connect with people who share the same interests as them.
